# BlaB! WS Q


BlaB! WS Q is a PhoneGap app (Android/IOS) for [BlaB! WS](https://justblab.com) and [BlaB! WS Pro](https://justblab.com) websocket chats. Your website visitors simply scan a QR code from the app and then join the chat. The app allows you to have native sound notifications via the PhoneGap media plugin - automatically played audio/video is disabled in mobile browsers. The back button triggers a prompt to exit the app.

## QR code

You can create a QR code image easily using any of the online QR generators available on the Internet. The QR code should start with `blabws://` and end without a trailing slash - `blabws://https://YOURSITE.COM/chat`


## Permissions

Although the app lists phone, microphone, storage and camera because of the PhoneGap media plugin, only the camera is required in order to scan the QR code.
